## VAI: Non-Realistic Tarkov Project

 
In general - this mod aims to make SPT more fun experience by sacrificing its realistic nature.

  

This is done by:

- Slowing down the combat by increasing health across the board (Begone days of head-eyes);
- Changing damage spreading, armor damage absorbtion and other mechanics;
- Rebalancing medical, food and other usable items;
- And others.

  

**New account is required for this mod to work properly.**

  

Changes:

1. The health of player and all NPCs was increased 6-10 times, status effects are changed accordingly;
2. Armor now absorbs a percentage of incoming damage depending on its class as long as it has any durability, this is counteracted by bullet's penetration;
3. Some weapons get a damage boost on shot:
	- Bolt-action sniper rifles: +300%
	- Marksman rifles: +100%
	- Pistols: +80%
	- Revolvers: +200%

4. When damage is dealt to any body part, percentage of this damage also applied to each other body part (Even when hit body part is not dead);

5. Healing items are now split into 2 categories:
	- In combat healing: standard healing while using;
	- Out of combat healing: slow health regen for several minutes;

6. Most food and med items give a long-term buffs (Ranging from 20 minutes to 1 hour);

7. Magazine restocking in raid is way faster, ammo stacks can hold more ammo;

8. Melee is split into 7 levels, depending on how hard it is to aquire them;

9. Recoil is drastically reduced for most weapons;

10. Item background colors are changed to reflect its usability;

11. Loot is adjusted to be more prevalent;

12. And minor QOL changes like in-raid timers, removed construction times for hideout, item restrictions in raid, skill fatigue and so on.

**Most of changes are configurable either in config files or F12 menu.**

  

Known issues:
- Stamina regen, damage modifier and max weight buffs do not stack;
- Some similar buffs are not displayed correctly (But they do stack);
- When starting new account "Out-of-raid" healing items which you start with have too many charges on them;
